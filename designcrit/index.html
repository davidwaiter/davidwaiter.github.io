<h2>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</h2>

<p>I used professional sports team pages to help inspire me on how i wanted to organize my site. Since i will be including miniature bios about individual players on my team, i want to get a good idea of how best to illustrate this. Even on the GA website I studied how they often listed instructors for certain course. Each instructor has a photo and a small bio associated with them.
</p>

<h2>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed make my site responsive. This is such a huge part of design because people are accessing website on so many different devices. It made me confident that my site could be viewed essentially anywhere.
</p>

<h2>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</h2>

<p>I find it easier to create something when I have a set of instructions to follow. When designing websites you have to imagine yourself as the user and think about how they would interact with the site. We all have endless amounts of experience using products and such, but its a lot tougher figuring out why they put things in certain places on page.

<h2>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</h2>

<p>Relative sizing was very tricky. It felt weird at first making some elements bigger even when they were viewed through a smaller browser.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</h2>

<p>It was a completely different way of thinking about design. Not only did i have to take into consideration what my site would look like on a full size browser, I also had to figure out how i wanted it to look on 3 different levels: small, medium, and large. It was fun trying to decide which elements could remain on the page and which were no longer necessary. It felt like i was creating an app almost. 
</p>

<h2>Group 1</h2>

<p>The Business of Fashion website was interesting in that large photos were used at the top of the  page, being the first thing a user would see. As you scroll down the page the site begins to include more text and several smaller pictures. A straight forward a clear nav bar immediately drew my attention as well.
</p>

<h2>Group 2</h2>

<p>For the Spectrum Powder Works site i really liked the photo scrolling capabilities it had. However the nav bar was in a very odd place at the bottom of the page, almost like a footer. The color of the nav bar appears to be too dark. Repositioning the nav at the top of the page just above the photos would be an ideal place for it, maybe set against a white background as well to make each item easier to read.</p>
